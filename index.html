        <h1 class="section-header">Step 1: Find a group</h1>
        <p> You'll want to find a group of friends (or, at the very least, people you don't hate) to play with. You'll
            need a group of 4 other people, ideally. You can decide as a group whether you'll play in-person, online, or a combination of the two. There are plenty of online platforms that will do a lot of the heavy-lifting for you, such as Roll20 or Incarnate.
        </p>
        <h2>A few roles to fill...</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Dungeon Master (DM): the organizer and storyteller driving the story forward. This is a difficult, high-demand role, so be grateful!</li>
            <li>Scribe: someone who will take detailed notes session-by-session of items collected, story details, NPCs, etc.</li>
            <li>Soundboard: having effective ambient music and sound effects greatly enhances the experience for everyone.</li>
            <li>Host: are you playing in-person? It might be a good idea to establish a single host or a hosting rotation.</li>
        </ol>
        <h1 class="section-header">Step 2: Establish your world</h1>
        <p>You and your group will need to agree on several items about your game world:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Game System: There are several different iterations of Dungeons & Dragons available over the many decades of the game's existence, and the rules vary greatly. You may even want to start with a less rules-heavy Tabletop RPG like "Kids on Bikes" or "Monster Hunters" to ease yourselves in.</li>
            <li>Setting: If you are playing D&D 5e (the most popular edition of D&D currently available, generally considered the "default") will you be playing in the base game setting of <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Faer%C3%BBn">Faerun</a>? Or will your DM create their own world?</li>
            <li>Ground Rules: Many groups like to establish player-to-player ground rules about things like roleplay do's and don'ts, rule lawyering, and other important factors in a group dynamic.</li>
            <li>Schedule: How often will you play? How often is realistic and/or reasonable? What will the group do if one player can't play but the rest want to continue on?</li>
        </ul>
        <h1 class="section-header">Step 3: Build and Play!</h1>
        <p>Individually, you'll need to create your own Player Characters and work through the details of your character build like ancestry (i.e. orc, human, elf), class, and ability scores. There are plenty of online resources for building a character--one popular resource is "D&D Beyond", linked <a href=https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/creating-a-character?srsltid=AfmBOootFgaLW-gqlfwhIm_QDrnxkR7NB0W2UrC9eI6Pp0aC2ehtcF6c>Here</a>.
