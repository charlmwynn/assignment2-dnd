        <h1>Let's Play!</h1>
        <p>Here is a sample "script" of what a snippet of any D&D session might look like.<br>
            Jessie: I want to listen at the door.<br>
            John: And I'll keep watch while she does.<br>
            DM: Okay, Aelynn, I'll need a Perception check, and Grog, I'll need another Perception from you.<br>
            [both players roll a D20, and add the result of their roll to their Perception bonus on their character sheet]<br>
            Jessie: 17.<br>
            John: 9.<br>
            DM: Okay. Grog, you're pretty sure that you don't see or hear anybody following you guys. Aelynn, you put your ear to the door and on the other side you hear muffled noises, it sounds like a scratching noise.<br>
            Jessie: Do I recognize the noise at all?<br>
            DM: Roll a nature check.<br>
            [Jessie rolls another D20, this time adding her result to her Nature bonus]<br>
            Jessie: Natural 20!<br>
            DM: Amazing. So, Aelynn, you're listening at the door, and you hear this scratching noise. You focus in, trying to identify the noise, and as you do a memory washes over you. You remember lying on the cold boards of the hayloft you grew up sleeping in, hearing the rats digging through the rotting hay around you as you tried to sleep. This noise sounds exactly like their little claws scratching against stone. With that natural 20...you also can identify that there is at least one swarm of rats and at least two much larger rats in the room.<br>
            Jessie: Gross.</p>
